## Introduction

Transitioning into an IT management role is a pivotal moment. While technical expertise is often the foundation for this move, success in management hinges on developing strong leadership and interpersonal skills. New managers frequently encounter common pitfalls that can hinder their effectiveness, impact team morale, and slow progress. Recognizing these traps and actively working to avoid them is essential for building a high-performing team and thriving as a leader.

## Core Mistakes and Traps

Here are some of the most common mistakes and traps new IT managers fall into, along with advice on how to avoid them:

### 1\. Micromanaging

Micromanaging involves excessive oversight and control over your team members' work, dictating how tasks should be completed, and constantly checking on progress.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** Stems from a desire to ensure quality and control, but it demonstrates a lack of trust, stifles autonomy and creativity, hinders skill development, and leads to manager burnout.
  * **Don't Do This:** Constantly check on minor tasks; provide overly detailed instructions on *how* to do something the team can handle; edit every piece of work; make decisions for the team that they are capable of making.
  * **Do This:** Trust your employees to do their jobs; clearly communicate the desired outcome and deadline, allowing flexibility in the process; focus on supporting your team and removing obstacles; provide feedback and guidance when needed, rather than taking over.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Micromanaging):** An IT manager assigns a server patching task but logs in multiple times to check the progress, dictating the exact command syntax to use despite the team member's experience.
      * **Effective:** The manager assigns the patching task, confirms the team member understands the goal and timeline, and is available for questions, trusting them to execute the process correctly.

### 2\. Avoiding Tough Conversations

Delaying or sidestepping difficult discussions, such as addressing performance issues, delivering constructive criticism, resolving conflicts, or discussing sensitive topics.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** Often due to discomfort with conflict or fear of damaging relationships (especially with former peers), but it allows problems to escalate, negatively impacts morale, and hinders individual and team performance. Ignoring necessary tough conversations to maintain a positive environment also falls into this category.
  * **Don't Do This:** Ignore poor performance hoping it improves; deliver critical feedback indirectly or through third parties; avoid mediating team conflicts; delay necessary disciplinary discussions.
  * **Do This:** Recognize tough conversations are inevitable; address issues promptly, privately, and directly; prepare by outlining key points and desired outcomes; approach discussions with empathy, clarity, and focus on behavior/situation. Address necessary tough conversations promptly and professionally to maintain a healthy team environment.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Avoiding Tough Conversations):** An IT manager notices a team member consistently failing to follow security protocols but avoids discussing it directly to avoid confrontation.
      * **Effective:** The manager schedules a private meeting, explains the specific security protocol violations and their potential risks, listens to the team member's perspective, and outlines the required corrective actions and consequences of continued non-compliance.

### 3\. Not Setting Clear Expectations

Failing to clearly define roles, responsibilities, goals, deadlines, performance standards, and project requirements for the team and individuals.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** May assume the team knows what's expected or hesitate to be directive, leading to confusion, misunderstandings, duplicated effort, missed deadlines, and frustration.
  * **Don't Do This:** Give vague instructions without specific deliverables/deadlines; assume understanding of task priorities; fail to communicate performance standards; change expectations frequently without clear communication.
  * **Do This:** Make expectations known from the start for tasks, roles, and performance; clearly define goals (e.g., using SMART criteria); regularly check in to ensure understanding; document important expectations.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Not Setting Clear Expectations):** A new IT manager asks the network team to "look into the slow internet issue" without specifying the scope (e.g., specific locations, times), desired analysis, or deadline.
      * **Effective:** The manager clarifies the scope (e.g., report of slow internet from users in Building C between 9-11 AM daily), requests analysis of potential causes and recommended solutions, and sets a deadline for an initial assessment report.

### 4\. Taking Credit for Your Team's Work

Presenting the successes and achievements of the team as solely your own.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** Pressure to demonstrate value might lead managers to mistakenly believe this elevates their status. It demoralizes the team, erodes trust, and discourages future effort.
  * **Don't Do This:** Use "I" when reporting team successes; fail to mention specific team members' contributions; present team deliverables as your own.
  * **Do This:** Acknowledge team efforts publicly and ensure they feel valued; use "we" when discussing accomplishments; highlight individual contributions to upper management and within the team; see your role as enabling team success.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Taking Credit):** An IT manager tells their director, "I successfully migrated the database to the cloud last quarter," without mentioning the extensive work done by the database administration team.
      * **Effective:** The manager tells their director, "Our database administration team successfully migrated the database to the cloud last quarter. [Team Member Name] was instrumental in leading the technical execution, and [Another Team Member Name] managed the rigorous testing process."

### 5\. Failing to Delegate

Holding onto tasks that could or should be done by team members, often believing they can do it better or faster.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** Reluctance to give up tasks or a belief it's quicker to do it themselves. This overburdens the manager, leads to burnout, and deprives the team of development opportunities.
  * **Don't Do This:** Keep all important/interesting tasks; believe delegating takes too much time; redo delegated tasks if not done exactly your way.
  * **Do This:** Share responsibilities to grow team skills and free up your time for strategic tasks; identify delegable tasks based on skills, interests, and development needs; provide clear instructions, resources, and authority; see delegation as an investment.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Failing to Delegate):** A new IT manager continues to handle all software license renewals because they are familiar with the process, even though an administrative assistant could manage this task.
      * **Effective:** The manager trains the administrative assistant on the license renewal process, provides access to the necessary systems and contacts, and delegates the responsibility, freeing up their time for more complex IT planning.

### 6\. Ignoring Feedback

Being unreceptive to feedback from the team, peers, or superiors, or assuming you are always right.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** May feel insecure or resistant to criticism. Ignoring feedback alienates the team, shows a lack of humility, prevents personal/professional growth, and hinders leadership improvement.
  * **Don't Do This:** Become defensive; dismiss feedback without consideration; assume you know best; fail to solicit feedback.
  * **Do This:** Be open to feedback from all sources; actively solicit feedback to understand how to improve; listen carefully without interrupting; thank the person; reflect and take action where appropriate.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Ignoring Feedback):** An IT manager receives feedback from the help desk team that the new ticketing system process is inefficient, but the manager dismisses their concerns without investigation.
      * **Effective:** The manager thanks the team for the feedback, schedules a meeting to understand the specific pain points in the new process, and works with the team to identify potential improvements.

### 7\. Making Decisions Too Slowly

Becoming paralyzed by analysis or fear of making the wrong choice, leading to delays and stalled progress.

  * **Why it's a Trap:** Feeling the weight of responsibility and wanting to be absolutely sure before acting. Excessive deliberation slows the team, misses opportunities, and creates frustration.
  * **Don't Do This:** Require perfect information before deciding; endlessly debate minor points; fear mistakes to the point of inaction; pass decisions up the chain unnecessarily.
  * **Do This:** Trust your instincts and available information; understand a timely decision is sometimes better than a delayed perfect one; assess risk and decide accordingly; empower your team to make decisions at their level; be prepared to decide and move forward.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Making Decisions Too Slowly):** A new IT manager spends weeks deliberating between two equally viable software vendors for a new tool, delaying the project implementation.
      * **Effective:** The manager sets a deadline for the decision, evaluates the key criteria for both vendors within that timeframe, consults with relevant team members for input, and makes a timely decision to keep the project on track.

### 8\. Praising Too Much or Insincerely

While praise is important, overdoing it or offering insincere compliments diminishes its value.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** A desire to make the team feel appreciated can lead to excessive or unwarranted praise, which comes across as insincere and makes it hard to discern truly exceptional work.
  * **Don't Do This:** Give generic praise without specifics; praise every single task regardless of effort/outcome; offer praise you don't genuinely mean.
  * **Do This:** Give praise, acknowledging efforts and achievements; be specific about what and why you are praising; ensure praise is genuine and tied to actual contributions.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Praising Too Much):** An IT manager tells every team member "Great job on that ticket\!" regardless of the complexity or speed of resolution.
      * **Effective:** The manager specifically praises a team member for "efficiently troubleshooting and resolving that complex network connectivity issue for the accounting department, which allowed them to close their books on time."

### 9\. Allowing Open Communication to Lead to Constant Interruptions

Encouraging open communication is beneficial, but failing to manage it can result in frequent disruptions that hinder focus and productivity.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Wanting to be approachable can lead to an "always available" policy without boundaries, resulting in constant non-urgent interruptions that make it hard to focus on important work.
  * **Don't Do This:** Allow interruptions anytime for any reason; let informal chats derail focused work; fail to establish norms around communication channels/response times.
  * **Do This:** Encourage open communication; establish guidelines (e.g., IM for quick questions, scheduled time for longer discussions); protect focused work time with "do not disturb" periods.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Allowing Constant Interruptions):** An IT manager responds immediately to every chat message, even during important meetings or focused work sessions.
      * **Effective:** The manager communicates availability status (e.g., busy, available) and encourages team members to bundle non-urgent questions or schedule short check-ins rather than interrupting constantly.

### 10\. Offering Help But Then Micromanaging or Taking Over

Offering support is good, but it should empower the team member, not result in the manager controlling the process or doing the work themselves.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** A desire to be helpful and ensure quality can lead to hovering or taking over tasks, which shows a lack of trust, prevents learning, and is demotivating. (Overlap with Micromanaging).
  * **Don't Do This:** Provide help by doing the task for the team member; dictate every step when offering assistance; use help offers to closely monitor/control.
  * **Do This:** Offer help, providing guidance and resources; empower team members to solve problems with your support; see help as an opportunity for coaching/development.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Offering Help and Micromanaging):** An IT manager is asked for help with a difficult script. They take control of the keyboard and write the code themselves while the team member watches.
      * **Effective:** The manager sits with the team member, discusses the problem, helps them outline the logic, suggests relevant documentation or syntax, and guides them as they write the code, allowing them to learn by doing.

### 11\. Letting Approachability Lead to a Lack of Authority

Being approachable is a strength, but it shouldn't come at the cost of your ability to make decisions, set direction, and maintain professional standards.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Aiming to be liked might lead to avoiding difficult decisions, setting firm boundaries, or asserting authority when needed, resulting in lack of direction, inconsistent standards, and being perceived as a peer rather than a leader.
  * **Don't Do This:** Avoid necessary decisions to please everyone; let team members disregard processes/deadlines without consequence; be hesitant to enforce rules/expectations.
  * **Do This:** Be approachable and build positive relationships; be clear about your role and expectations; make decisions confidently, even if unpopular; be firm but fair in enforcing standards.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Lack of Authority):** An IT manager is friends with team members and allows them to bypass change management procedures because they complain about the process.
      * **Effective:** The manager maintains a friendly relationship but reinforces the importance of change management for system stability and security, explaining the reasoning behind the process and ensuring compliance.

### 12\. Letting Empathy Interfere with Professional Boundaries

Being empathetic to personal issues is good, but it shouldn't compromise professional standards or boundaries.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Wanting to support team members can lead to allowing personal issues to consistently impact work performance without intervention or becoming overly involved in personal lives, creating an unprofessional environment and potentially frustrating other team members.
  * **Don't Do This:** Allow personal issues to excuse consistent poor performance without intervention; become a therapist; share your own personal issues excessively.
  * **Do This:** Be empathetic to personal issues within professional boundaries; understand company support policies; focus on solutions that support the employee while meeting work responsibilities; maintain appropriate professional boundaries.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Empathy Interfering):** An IT manager allows a team member who is stressed about personal issues to repeatedly miss project deadlines without addressing the impact on the team or exploring support options.
      * **Effective:** The manager expresses empathy, discusses the impact of missed deadlines, explores company resources like EAP, and works with the employee on a temporary plan to manage workload and seek support while ensuring critical tasks are covered.

### 13\. Sugarcoating Constructive Feedback

Delivering feedback on areas for improvement is necessary, but softening it too much to avoid hurting feelings diminishes its effectiveness.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Fear of upsetting or demotivating. Sugarcoating makes it hard for the employee to understand the issue's severity, hindering growth.
  * **Don't Do This:** Bury critical feedback in excessive praise; use vague language to avoid being direct; avoid negative feedback altogether.
  * **Do This:** Provide constructive feedback directly and clearly; focus on specific behaviors/outcomes; deliver feedback with empathy and a focus on improvement.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Sugarcoating):** An IT manager tells a network administrator, "You're doing great with most of the firewall rules, maybe just a tiny bit more attention to detail sometimes?" instead of directly addressing specific errors in recent firewall configurations.
      * **Effective:** The manager says, "Overall, your work on firewall rules is solid. However, I've noticed a pattern in the last few configurations where the source IP ranges were incorrect. This is a critical area for security, so let's review the documentation and ensure accuracy on future changes."

### 14\. Showing Patience with Mistakes But Tolerating Repeated Negligence

Patience with genuine mistakes during the learning process is good, but allowing a pattern of repeated errors due to carelessness or lack of effort is detrimental.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Wanting to be understanding, but failing to address repeated mistakes, especially from negligence, signals low performance is acceptable and frustrates diligent team members.
  * **Don't Do This:** Ignore repeated errors without addressing the root cause; make excuses for consistent poor performance; fail to set expectations for accuracy/quality.
  * **Do This:** Show patience with honest mistakes and use them as learning opportunities; address repeated instances of the same mistake, especially if from lack of care; set clear expectations for quality; implement processes/training if needed for recurring issues.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Tolerating Negligence):** An IT manager keeps fixing the same documentation errors made by a team member in the IT knowledge base without discussing the issue with them.
      * **Effective:** The manager discusses the repeated documentation errors with the team member, reinforces the importance of accuracy in the knowledge base for the whole team, offers additional training on documentation standards, and sets a clear expectation for improvement.

### 15\. Offering Flexible Hours But Compromising on Essential Deadlines

Providing flexibility is positive, but it should not lead to missing critical project deadlines.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Wanting to support work-life balance, but if not managed, flexibility can lead to a lack of accountability for deadlines if team members interpret it as permission to miss targets.
  * **Don't Do This:** Allow flexible schedules to negatively impact team coordination/timelines; fail to communicate the importance of deadlines; assume flexibility means less rigid deadlines.
  * **Do This:** Offer flexible hours where possible, trusting employees to manage time; clearly communicate essential deadlines/milestones; ensure flexibility doesn't negatively impact collaboration or meeting critical deadlines; hold team members accountable for timely delivery.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Compromising Deadlines):** An IT manager allows a team member to repeatedly push back their task completion dates due to their flexible schedule, causing delays in a critical software release.
      * **Effective:** The manager reinforces that while hours are flexible, project deadlines are not. They work with the team member to better manage their time and workload within their flexible schedule to ensure timely completion of critical tasks for the release.

### 16\. Being Transparent But Oversharing Confidential Information

Sharing information builds trust, but disclosing confidential or sensitive details inappropriately erodes trust and creates discomfort.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Mistakenly believing complete transparency is always best, leading to sharing unauthorized or inappropriate information, violating privacy, creating anxiety, and damaging credibility.
  * **Don't Do This:** Share confidential information about other employees (e.g., performance, salary); disclose sensitive company information; speculate or share unconfirmed information that could cause worry.
  * **Do This:** Be transparent with appropriate decisions/information; understand what is confidential; communicate openly about team goals/challenges/progress within appropriate bounds.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Oversharing):** An IT manager tells the team about budget cuts discussed in a confidential management meeting before the official announcement, causing unnecessary worry and speculation.
      * **Effective:** The manager waits for the official communication regarding budget changes and then facilitates a discussion with the team about how it might impact their projects and priorities in a transparent but appropriate manner.

### 17\. Creating a Positive Work Environment But Ignoring Necessary Tough Conversations

Fostering a positive environment is important, but not at the expense of addressing issues that require difficult discussions.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Wanting to maintain a harmonious environment and avoiding conflict or tough conversations about performance/behavior. Ignoring issues allows negativity or underperformance to persist, harming the positive environment and potentially frustrating others. (Overlap with Avoiding Tough Conversations).
  * **Don't Do This:** Avoid addressing conflict or negative behavior; fail to provide critical feedback to maintain a "positive" atmosphere; let performance issues slide to avoid uncomfortable conversations.
  * **Do This:** Create a positive and supportive environment; address necessary tough conversations promptly and professionally; see addressing difficult issues as maintaining a healthy team environment.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Ignoring Tough Conversations):** An IT manager ignores a team member's consistently negative attitude in team meetings to avoid confrontation, which is bringing down overall team morale.
      * **Effective:** The manager pulls the team member aside privately, discusses the impact of their negative attitude on the team, and sets clear expectations for more constructive participation in meetings, reinforcing the importance of a positive team environment.

### 18\. Offering Mentoring But Imposing Your Way as the Only Way

Mentoring involves guiding and supporting growth, not forcing your own methods or solutions onto others.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Confidence in one's own methods leads to telling mentees how *you* would do things without considering their style or alternative valid approaches, stifling creativity and preventing them from developing problem-solving skills.
  * **Don't Do This:** Insist your way is the only correct way; provide solutions instead of guiding the mentee to find their own; dismiss alternative approaches.
  * **Do This:** Offer mentoring/guidance to help development; share insights but encourage independent thinking; ask questions to help mentees explore options; be open to learning from mentees.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Imposing Your Way):** A new IT manager is mentoring a junior sysadmin on setting up a new server and dictates every command and configuration step without explaining the underlying concepts or allowing the junior to research alternatives.
      * **Effective:** The manager explains the goal of the server setup, discusses potential approaches and best practices, and guides the junior sysadmin as they perform the configuration, asking questions to check their understanding and encouraging them to research solutions for minor issues.

### 19\. Promoting Work-Life Balance But Ignoring Productivity Goals

Encouraging a healthy work-life balance is important, but it must be balanced with the need to achieve productivity goals and meet objectives.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Focusing heavily on balance can lead to neglecting productivity targets or failing to ensure work is completed efficiently, impacting the team's ability to meet objectives and contribute to organizational success.
  * **Don't Do This:** Prioritize balance so much that productivity/deadlines are missed; fail to set clear productivity expectations; avoid discussing performance/output.
  * **Do This:** Promote healthy work-life balance; set clear productivity goals/expectations; help team members manage workload for both balance and results; have conversations about productivity when necessary.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective (Ignoring Productivity):** An IT manager tells the team to never work overtime but doesn't address the fact that the team consistently fails to complete assigned tasks during standard hours due to poor workflow.
      * **Effective:** The manager encourages a healthy work-life balance but also works with the team to analyze their workflow, identify bottlenecks, implement more efficient processes, and prioritize tasks to ensure they can meet their productivity goals within standard working hours.

## Additional Challenges and How to Navigate Them

Beyond the core traps, new IT managers often face other significant hurdles as they transition into their leadership role:

### Shifting from Peer to Manager

The transition from being a team member to leading that same team, often including former colleagues.

  * **Don't Do This:** Try to remain "one of the gang" in a way that undermines authority or objectivity; show favoritism to former friends; fail to establish professional boundaries.
  * **Do This:** Acknowledge the change in relationship directly and respectfully; be fair and consistent in treatment of all team members; establish clear professional boundaries while maintaining positive relationships; focus on leading and supporting the *entire* team.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager continues to participate in casual complaining about upper management with former peers, undermining their own authority and creating an unprofessional dynamic.
      * **Effective:** The manager has an open conversation with former peers about the new dynamic, emphasizing their commitment to supporting the team while upholding management responsibilities, and maintains professional conduct in team interactions.

### Understanding the New Role and Responsibilities

The scope of a manager's role is broader than being an individual contributor, involving administrative tasks, performance management, strategic input, and more.

  * **Don't Do This:** Assume you know everything about the role without seeking guidance; focus solely on technical aspects if promoted from a technical role; neglect administrative or "people" aspects.
  * **Do This:** Seek clarity on responsibilities from your manager/HR; actively learn about all facets of management (performance, budgeting, strategy); understand your primary role is to enable team success.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager, promoted from a senior network engineer role, continues to spend most of their time on complex network configurations and troubleshooting, neglecting team meetings, one-on-ones, and project planning.
      * **Effective:** The manager consciously shifts their focus, dedicates time to learning about performance management processes, schedules regular team and individual meetings, and prioritizes project oversight and team development activities.

### Setting Boundaries

Establishing clear lines between work life and personal life, and professional boundaries in interactions with the team.

  * **Don't Do This:** Be available 24/7; allow personal issues to interfere with professional responsibilities (or vice versa); become overly involved in personal lives in a way that compromises professionalism.
  * **Do This:** Define and communicate working hours; manage time effectively to avoid constant overtime; maintain professional boundaries while being approachable; protect personal time to avoid burnout.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager responds to non-urgent support requests from team members via chat at 10 PM.
      * **Effective:** The manager communicates typical working hours and encourages team members to use appropriate channels for urgent (e.g., on-call contact) vs. non-urgent issues (e.g., email, ticketing system during work hours).

### Managing Former Peers

Leading individuals who were previously your equals requires navigating the changed dynamic.

  * **Don't Do This:** Assert authority aggressively or micromanage former peers; continue existing casual dynamics that undermine leadership; fail to address performance issues due to discomfort.
  * **Do This:** Have an open conversation about the new working relationship and expectations; be fair, consistent, and objective in decisions and treatment; focus on supporting their success; address performance issues professionally and directly.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager avoids giving constructive feedback to a former peer who is consistently submitting code with numerous bugs because they are uncomfortable doing so.
      * **Effective:** The manager schedules a private meeting with the former peer, provides specific examples of the code issues, explains the impact on the project, and works with them on a plan for improving code quality, treating the situation professionally.

### Difficulty Holding People Accountable

A desire to be liked can make it challenging to ensure team members meet their commitments and performance standards.

  * **Don't Do This:** Avoid addressing missed deadlines or incomplete tasks; make excuses for underperforming team members; fail to follow through on consequences.
  * **Do This:** Clearly communicate expectations and deliverables; track progress and check in regularly; address instances where commitments are not met promptly and professionally; be consistent in applying standards.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager assigns a task to configure a new server by Friday, but when Friday comes and it's not done, they just silently reassign it or do it themselves.
      * **Effective:** The manager checks in with the team member on Friday, understands why the task wasn't completed, discusses the importance of meeting deadlines for team dependencies, and works with the team member to establish a revised completion plan and address any roadblocks.

### Overcommitting the Team

Agreeing to too many projects or unrealistic deadlines without properly assessing the team's capacity.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Eagerness to please stakeholders can lead to saying "yes" without considering the impact on the team's workload, resulting in burnout, missed deadlines, and decreased quality.
  * **Don't Do This:** Agree to all requests without evaluating capacity; fear pushing back on unrealistic demands; fail to communicate workload issues to your manager or stakeholders.
  * **Do This:** Understand your team's capacity and workload; assess new requests' impact on priorities; communicate realistically about what the team can achieve and when; be prepared to negotiate deadlines or resources.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager agrees to take on three new high-priority development projects simultaneously without assessing the team's current project load and capacity.
      * **Effective:** The manager receives the requests for the new projects, reviews the team's current commitments and estimated effort for existing work, and discusses with their director that the team has capacity for two new projects in the requested timeframe, proposing a phased approach or the need for additional resources for all three.

### Lack of Strategic Focus Due to Prioritizing Individual Happiness

Focusing heavily on individual team member happiness without aligning efforts with broader strategic goals.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Prioritizing team well-being is good, but if it leads to a lack of focus on the team's contribution to business strategy or a reluctance to push for challenging goals, the team may be comfortable but less impactful.
  * **Don't Do This:** Prioritize team comfort over achieving necessary goals; fail to communicate the team's strategic contribution; let individual preferences dictate priorities without considering strategic importance.
  * **Do This:** Balance team well-being with strategic objectives; clearly communicate how the team's work contributes to organizational goals; set challenging but achievable goals aligned with strategy; help team members see the value of their work beyond individual tasks.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** An IT manager allows team members to spend excessive time on internal tooling improvements that they find interesting, even though these don't align with the company's current strategic focus on external customer-facing products.
      * **Effective:** The manager helps the team understand the company's strategic priorities and allocates the majority of resources to projects directly supporting those priorities, while perhaps allowing a small percentage of time for exploring internal tool improvements that could eventually support strategic goals.

### Burnout from Trying to Please Everyone

Attempting to meet the expectations of every team member, stakeholder, and manager simultaneously, leading to exhaustion.

  * **Why it's a Mistake:** Feeling pressure to keep everyone happy is unsustainable and leads to burnout, frustration, and inability to effectively lead.
  * **Don't Do This:** Say yes to every request to avoid disappointing; put everyone else's needs before your own well-being; avoid setting boundaries with demanding stakeholders.
  * **Do This:** Recognize you cannot please everyone; prioritize based on team/organizational needs; manage expectations and communicate boundaries; protect your own time and energy.
  * **Example:**
      * **Ineffective:** A new IT manager constantly tries to fulfill last-minute requests from multiple departments and their own manager, working late nights and weekends, leading to exhaustion and decreased decision-making ability.
      * **Effective:** The manager prioritizes incoming requests based on impact and urgency, communicates realistic timelines to stakeholders, and learns to politely push back or negotiate deadlines when faced with an unmanageable workload, ensuring they can sustain their efforts.

By recognizing and actively working to avoid these common mistakes and traps, new managers can build trust, empower their teams, drive performance, and develop into effective leaders.
