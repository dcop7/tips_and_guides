## Why Delegate in IT?

Delegation is more than just offloading tasks; it's a strategic imperative for IT leaders.

### Improves Efficiency

By assigning tasks to others, you free up your own time to focus on higher-level activities that require your unique skills and experience. This leads to better overall productivity for the entire team.

### Develops Your Team

Delegation provides team members with opportunities to learn new skills, take on more responsibility, and grow professionally. This is crucial for their development and for building a more capable and versatile team.

### Inspires Creativity

Different individuals bring different perspectives and approaches to a task. Delegating can lead to innovative solutions and more effective outcomes than if a single person were to handle everything.

### Balances Workloads

Distributing tasks more evenly across the team helps prevent burnout among individuals and ensures that projects progress smoothly.

### Lets You Lead

Effective delegation allows IT leaders to move away from day-to-day operational tasks and focus on strategic planning, team development, and driving the IT vision forward.

## What and When to Delegate

Deciding what and when to delegate is as important as knowing how. Here are some frameworks to help you make those decisions:

### The 70% Rule

If someone on your team can do a task 70% as well as you can, it's worth delegating. The remaining 30% is an opportunity for them to learn and grow, and for you to coach and guide.

### The Skill / Will Matrix

This matrix helps you match tasks with individuals based on their current skill level and their motivation ("will") to perform the task.

|           | High Will       | Low Will       |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| **High Skill** | Empower         | Motivate       |
| **Low Skill** | Guide/Direct    | Don't Delegate |

  * **High Skill, High Will:** Empower these individuals with significant autonomy.
  * **High Skill, Low Will:** Understand their lack of motivation and try to re-engage or motivate them.
  * **Low Skill, High Will:** Guide and direct them closely, providing support and training.
  * **Low Skill, Low Will:** These tasks are generally not suitable for delegation to these individuals.

### The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important)

Categorize tasks based on their urgency and importance:

  * **Urgent and Important:** Do these yourself.
  * **Important, Not Urgent:** Decide when to do these.
  * **Urgent, Not Important:** Delegate these.
  * **Not Urgent, Not Important:** Eliminate these.

Focus on delegating tasks that are urgent but not necessarily require your unique expertise.

### The 80/20 Rule

Identify the 20% of your efforts that create 80% of the results. Conversely, the remaining 80% of your efforts might only generate 20% of the results. Delegate the less impactful 80% of tasks to free up time for the vital few.

### Types of IT Tasks Suitable for Delegation

Many tasks in an IT department can be effectively delegated, including:

  * Routine maintenance (e.g., server patching, software updates)
  * Tier 1 or 2 support issues
  * Documentation creation and updates
  * Basic configuration tasks
  * Testing and quality assurance
  * Research on new technologies or tools
  * Simple script development
  * Reporting and data collection

### Tasks NOT to Delegate

While delegation is powerful, some tasks should generally remain with the manager or leader:

  * Confidential or sensitive matters (e.g., performance reviews, disciplinary actions)
  * Strategic planning and vision setting
  * High-stakes decision-making
  * Tasks that are critical for your personal development or core responsibilities
  * Crisis management (initially, though tasks can be delegated during a crisis)
  * Mentoring and coaching (while tasks can be delegated *as part of* mentoring)

## How to Delegate Effectively (The DELEGATE Model)

A structured approach to delegation ensures clarity and success. The DELEGATE model provides a useful framework:

### Define: Clearly Specify the Task

  * Clearly articulate the task to be done.
  * Define the desired outcome or objective.
  * Specify any constraints, deadlines, or standards.

### Establish: Communicate Your Expectations

  * Explain *why* the task is important.
  * Communicate the level of authority granted.
  * Outline reporting requirements and check-in points.

### List: Identify and Provide Necessary Resources

  * Ensure the team member has the required tools, access, information, and budget.
  * Identify any potential obstacles and discuss how to overcome them.

### Empower: Give Proper Authority and Trust

  * Grant the team member the authority to make decisions related to the task within defined parameters.
  * Show trust in their ability to complete the task successfully. Avoid micromanagement.

### Guide: Be Available to Provide Direction

  * Offer support and guidance without taking over the task.
  * Be available to answer questions and provide clarification.

### Assess: Monitor Progress Consistently

  * Set up agreed-upon check-in points to review progress.
  * Monitor without micromanaging, focusing on outcomes rather than just the process.

### Thank: Recognize and Appreciate Efforts

  * Acknowledge the team member's effort and contribution.
  * Provide positive reinforcement for a job well done.

### Evaluate: Review Results and Make Adjustments

  * Once the task is complete, review the outcome against the defined objectives.
  * Provide constructive feedback.
  * Discuss lessons learned and identify areas for improvement for future delegation.

## Choosing the Right Person

Selecting the appropriate team member for a delegated task is crucial for success. Consider the following factors:

### Skills and Experience

Does the individual have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform the task effectively? Is this an opportunity for them to apply existing skills or develop new ones?

### Workload and Availability

Is the individual's current workload manageable enough to take on an additional task? Do they have the availability within the required timeframe?

### Interest and Motivation

Is the individual interested in the task? High motivation often leads to better performance and a more positive experience.

### Development Opportunity

Can this task serve as a development opportunity for the individual, helping them to grow their skills and career?

## Communication and Follow-up

Clear and consistent communication is the bedrock of successful delegation.

### Clear Instructions

Provide instructions that are unambiguous and easy to understand. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it clearly.

### Setting Check-in Points

Agree on regular check-in points to discuss progress, address challenges, and provide feedback. The frequency will depend on the complexity and duration of the task.

### Providing Feedback

Offer constructive feedback throughout the process, not just at the end. This helps the individual learn and adjust as needed.

### Using Communication Tools

Leverage project management tools, collaboration platforms, and regular meetings to facilitate communication and tracking of delegated tasks.

## Potential Challenges and How to Overcome Them

Delegation can sometimes present challenges. Being aware of them and planning how to address them is key.

### Fear of Losing Control

Managers may fear losing control or that the task won't be done to their standards. Overcome this by clearly defining expectations, providing necessary resources, and establishing check-in points. Trust your team.

### Belief That It's Quicker to Do It Yourself

While initially it might seem faster to do a task yourself, this is not sustainable for long-term growth and efficiency. Invest the time to delegate properly, and you will save time in the long run.

### Lack of Trust

Building trust takes time and consistent positive interactions. Start by delegating smaller, lower-risk tasks and gradually increase responsibility as trust grows.

### Lack of Clarity in Instructions

Vague or incomplete instructions lead to confusion and errors. Take the time to clearly define the task, objectives, and expectations. Encourage questions.

### Resistance from Team Members

Some team members might resist delegation due to feeling overwhelmed, lacking confidence, or not understanding the value of the task. Address their concerns, provide support, and highlight the benefits of taking on the task (e.g., skill development).
