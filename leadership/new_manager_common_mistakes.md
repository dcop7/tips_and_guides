## Introduction

The first step into management is a significant transition. New managers often aim to foster positive relationships with their teams, creating a supportive and friendly environment. While kindness and empathy are essential leadership qualities, an overemphasis on avoiding discomfort or seeking approval can lead to common mistakes that ultimately hinder the team's performance and the manager's effectiveness. This guide explores 12 such pitfalls and provides practical advice for navigating them, ensuring that kindness is balanced with the necessary assertiveness and focus on results.

## The 12 Common Mistakes and How to Navigate Them

Based on the provided image, here are common mistakes new managers might make, often stemming from a desire to be kind, and how to avoid them:

### Mistake 1: Praising Too Much or Insincerely

While praising your team is important, overdoing it or offering insincere compliments diminishes the value of the praise.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants to make their team feel appreciated. However, excessive or unwarranted praise can come across as insincere, making it difficult for employees to discern when their work is truly exceptional. It can also lead to a sense of entitlement or a lack of understanding of what constitutes high performance.

#### Don't Do This

  * Give generic praise ("Great job\!") without specific examples.
  * Praise every single task, regardless of the effort or outcome.
  * Offer praise you don't genuinely mean.

#### Do This

  * Give praise to your team, acknowledging their efforts and achievements.
  * Be specific about *what* you are praising and *why* it was impactful.
  * Ensure praise is genuine and tied to actual contributions and positive behaviors.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Praising Too Much):** A new manager tells every team member "Excellent work on that email\!" regardless of the email's quality or importance. Team members start to ignore the praise.
  * **Effective:** The manager says, "Sarah, I really appreciated how you handled that customer email about the technical issue. Your clear explanation and quick response resolved the problem efficiently, and the customer specifically mentioned your helpfulness."

### Mistake 2: Allowing Open Communication to Lead to Constant Interruptions

Encouraging open communication is good, but not managing it can result in frequent disruptions.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants to be approachable and available. However, an "always available" policy without boundaries can lead to constant interruptions from team members for non-urgent matters, making it difficult for the manager to focus on their own work and strategic tasks.

#### Don't Do This

  * Allow interruptions at any time for any reason.
  * Let informal chats derail important focused work.
  * Fail to establish norms around communication channels and response times.

#### Do This

  * Encourage open communication within the team.
  * Establish guidelines for communication, such as using instant messaging for quick questions and scheduling time for longer discussions.
  * Protect focused work time by setting "do not disturb" periods.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Allowing Constant Interruptions):** A new manager leaves their office door open and allows team members to walk in and ask questions whenever they have one, regardless of whether the manager is in a meeting or working on a critical task.
  * **Effective:** The manager encourages questions and open discussion but establishes "office hours" for casual check-ins or requests that are not urgent. They also encourage team members to try and find answers themselves or ask colleagues before coming to the manager.

### Mistake 3: Offering Help But Then Micromanaging or Taking Over

A kind manager wants to be supportive, but offering help should not lead to controlling how the task is done or completing it yourself.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A desire to be helpful and ensure quality can lead new managers to hover over team members or jump in to "fix" things. This demonstrates a lack of trust, prevents the team member from learning, and can be demotivating. (This ties closely to the Micromanaging trap).

#### Don't Do This

  * Provide help by doing the task for the team member.
  * Dictate every step the team member should take when offering assistance.
  * Use offers of help as an opportunity to closely monitor and control the work.

#### Do This

  * Offer help when needed, providing guidance and resources.
  * Empower team members to solve problems themselves with your support.
  * See offering help as an opportunity for coaching and development, not control.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Offering Help and Micromanaging):** A team member asks for help with a complex formula in a spreadsheet. The new manager takes the laptop and completes the formula themselves without explaining the steps or allowing the team member to try.
  * **Effective:** The manager sits with the team member, explains the logic needed for the formula, guides them through the steps, and allows the team member to implement it, offering support and answering questions along the way.

### Mistake 4: Letting Approachability Lead to a Lack of Authority

Being approachable is a strength, but it shouldn't come at the expense of your leadership position and the ability to make decisions and set direction.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A new manager aiming to be liked might avoid making difficult decisions, setting firm boundaries, or asserting their authority when necessary. This can lead to a lack of direction, inconsistent standards, and a perception that the manager is a peer rather than a leader.

#### Don't Do This

  * Avoid making necessary decisions to please everyone.
  * Let team members disregard processes or deadlines without consequence.
  * Be hesitant to enforce rules or expectations.

#### Do This

  * Be approachable and build positive relationships with your team.
  * Be clear about your role as a leader and the expectations you have.
  * Make decisions confidently, even if they are not universally popular.
  * Be firm but fair in enforcing standards and addressing issues.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Lack of Authority):** A new manager wants to be seen as a friend and allows team members to consistently arrive late for meetings without addressing the issue, leading to decreased meeting productivity.
  * **Effective:** The manager maintains a friendly demeanor but also reinforces the importance of punctuality for team meetings and addresses repeated lateness directly and professionally with the individual.

### Mistake 5: Letting Empathy Interfere with Professional Boundaries

Being empathetic to employees' personal issues is commendable, but it shouldn't lead to compromising professional standards or boundaries.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager will want to support team members going through personal difficulties. However, allowing personal issues to consistently impact work performance without addressing it, or becoming overly involved in employees' personal lives, can create an unprofessional environment and lead to resentment from other team members who are maintaining their performance.

#### Don't Do This

  * Allow personal issues to excuse consistent poor performance without intervention.
  * Become a therapist for your team members.
  * Share your own personal issues excessively with your team.

#### Do This

  * Be empathetic to employees' personal issues and offer support within professional boundaries.
  * Understand company policies regarding leave and support resources.
  * Focus on finding solutions that support the employee while ensuring work responsibilities are met, potentially through temporary adjustments or utilizing company resources.
  * Maintain appropriate professional boundaries in your interactions.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Empathy Interfering with Boundaries):** A new manager knows a team member is going through a tough time and allows them to miss deadlines repeatedly without discussing the impact on the team or exploring options for support, leading to project delays and frustration among other team members.
  * **Effective:** The manager expresses empathy for the team member's situation, discusses the impact on their work, and works with them to create a temporary plan that includes utilizing company resources like EAP (Employee Assistance Program) and adjusting some deadlines where possible, while ensuring critical tasks are covered.

### Mistake 6: Sugarcoating Constructive Feedback

Delivering constructive feedback is necessary for growth, but sugarcoating it to avoid hurting feelings diminishes its effectiveness.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager may fear upsetting or demotivating a team member by providing direct feedback on areas for improvement. However, sugarcoating feedback makes it difficult for the employee to understand the severity or nature of the issue, hindering their ability to learn and grow.

#### Don't Do This

  * Bury critical feedback in excessive praise.
  * Use vague language to avoid being direct about performance issues.
  * Avoid giving negative feedback altogether.

#### Do This

  * Provide constructive feedback directly and clearly.
  * Focus on specific behaviors or outcomes, not personal attributes.
  * Deliver feedback with empathy and a focus on helping the individual improve.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Sugarcoating Feedback):** A new manager tells a team member, "Your presentation was really good, lots of interesting points, and you spoke clearly. Maybe next time, just think about the flow a little bit?" without specifically addressing the disjointed structure and lack of clear conclusion.
  * **Effective:** The manager says, "Your presentation had some strong points, particularly the data you presented. For next time, focus on creating a clearer structure with a strong introduction and conclusion to help the audience follow the key takeaways. For instance, dedicating more time to explaining the implications of the data at the end would be beneficial."

### Mistake 7: Showing Patience with Mistakes But Tolerating Repeated Negligence

Patience with genuine mistakes is important, but tolerating repeated errors due to carelessness or a lack of effort is detrimental.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants to be understanding when mistakes happen as part of the learning process. However, failing to address a pattern of repeated mistakes, especially if they stem from negligence or a lack of attention to detail, signals that low performance is acceptable and can frustrate diligent team members.

#### Don't Do This

  * Ignore repeated errors without addressing the root cause.
  * Make excuses for a team member's consistent poor performance.
  * Fail to set expectations for accuracy and quality.

#### Do This

  * Show patience with honest mistakes and use them as learning opportunities.
  * Address repeated instances of the same mistake, especially if they indicate a lack of care or understanding.
  * Set clear expectations for quality and accuracy.
  * Implement processes or provide additional training if needed to address recurring issues.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Tolerating Negligence):** A new manager repeatedly corrects the same error in a team member's reports without discussing the pattern of mistakes or providing additional training on the reporting tool.
  * **Effective:** The manager has a conversation with the team member about the recurring error, explores why it's happening (e.g., lack of understanding, rushing), provides additional training or resources, and sets a clear expectation for improvement.

### Mistake 8: Offering Flexible Hours But Compromising on Essential Deadlines

Offering flexibility can boost morale, but not at the cost of missing critical project deadlines.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants to support work-life balance and offer flexibility. However, if not managed properly, this can lead to a lack of accountability for deadlines, especially if team members interpret flexibility as permission to miss targets.

#### Don't Do This

  * Allow flexible schedules to negatively impact team coordination or project timelines.
  * Fail to communicate the importance of meeting deadlines, even with flexible hours.
  * Assume that offering flexibility means deadlines are less rigid.

#### Do This

  * Offer flexible working hours where possible, trusting employees to manage their time.
  * Clearly communicate essential deadlines and milestones.
  * Ensure that flexible arrangements do not negatively impact team collaboration or the ability to meet critical deadlines.
  * Hold team members accountable for delivering work on time, regardless of their specific schedule.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Compromising Deadlines):** A new manager tells the team they can work flexible hours. When a key project deadline approaches, some team members haven't completed their tasks, citing their flexible schedules. The manager doesn't push back, and the deadline is missed.
  * **Effective:** The manager offers flexible hours but clearly states that all team members are responsible for ensuring their work is completed by agreed-upon deadlines. They use project management tools to track progress and have proactive conversations with team members if their progress indicates a risk to a deadline.

### Mistake 9: Being Transparent But Oversharing Confidential Information

Sharing information builds trust, but oversharing confidential or sensitive details can erode trust and create discomfort.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager might believe that complete transparency is always best and share information they are not authorized to disclose or that is inappropriate to share with the entire team. This can violate privacy, create unnecessary anxiety, and damage credibility.

#### Don't Do This

  * Share confidential information about other employees (e.g., performance issues, salary).
  * Disclose sensitive company information that is not public knowledge.
  * Speculate or share unconfirmed information that could cause worry.

#### Do This

  * Be transparent with decisions and relevant information where appropriate.
  * Understand what information is confidential and should not be shared.
  * Communicate openly about team goals, challenges, and progress.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Oversharing):** A new manager tells the team about the reasons behind another employee's departure, including confidential details about their performance issues.
  * **Effective:** The manager informs the team about the employee's departure in a general way, focusing on the impact on the team's workload and the plan for covering responsibilities, without disclosing confidential information.

### Mistake 10: Creating a Positive Work Environment But Ignoring Necessary Tough Conversations

Fostering a positive environment is important, but not at the expense of addressing issues that require difficult discussions.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants to maintain a harmonious and positive team dynamic and may avoid conflict or difficult conversations about performance, behavior, or team issues. Ignoring these issues allows negativity or underperformance to persist, ultimately harming the positive environment they are trying to create and potentially leading to resentment among other team members.

#### Don't Do This

  * Avoid addressing conflict or negative behavior within the team.
  * Fail to provide critical feedback to maintain a "positive" atmosphere.
  * Let performance issues slide to avoid uncomfortable conversations.

#### Do This

  * Create a positive and supportive work environment.
  * Address necessary tough conversations promptly and professionally.
  * See addressing difficult issues as a way to maintain a healthy and productive team environment in the long run.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Ignoring Tough Conversations):** A new manager notices tension between two team members but avoids intervening to maintain a positive environment. The tension escalates, affecting the entire team's morale and collaboration.
  * **Effective:** The manager addresses the conflict directly with the involved team members, facilitates a conversation to understand the issues, and works with them to find a resolution, prioritizing the health of the team dynamic.

### Mistake 11: Offering Mentoring But Imposing Your Way as the Only Way

Mentoring involves guiding and supporting growth, not forcing your own methods onto others.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A new manager, confident in their own experience and methods, might try to mentor by simply telling team members how *they* would do things, without considering the team member's strengths, learning style, or alternative valid approaches. This stifles creativity and prevents the mentee from developing their own problem-solving skills.

#### Don't Do This

  * Insist that your way is the only correct way to perform a task.
  * Provide solutions instead of guiding the mentee to find their own.
  * Dismiss alternative approaches suggested by the mentee.

#### Do This

  * Offer mentoring and guidance to help your team members develop.
  * Share your experiences and insights, but also encourage independent thinking and problem-solving.
  * Ask questions that help the mentee explore different options and arrive at their own solutions.
  * Be open to learning from your mentees as well.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Imposing Your Way):** A new manager is mentoring a junior developer and tells them exactly which libraries to use and how to structure the code, without discussing alternative approaches or allowing the developer to research and propose their own solutions.
  * **Effective:** The manager discusses the problem with the junior developer, suggests some potential approaches and resources, and asks the developer to research and propose a solution, offering guidance and feedback on their ideas.

### Mistake 12: Promoting Work-Life Balance But Ignoring Productivity Goals

Encouraging work-life balance is important, but it must be balanced with the need to achieve productivity goals.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager wants their team to avoid burnout and have a healthy work-life balance. However, if this focus leads to neglecting productivity targets or failing to ensure that work is completed efficiently, it can impact the team's ability to meet objectives and contribute to the organization's success.

#### Don't Do This

  * Prioritize work-life balance to the extent that productivity and deadlines are consistently missed.
  * Fail to set clear productivity expectations.
  * Avoid discussing performance or output with team members.

#### Do This

  * Promote a healthy work-life balance within your team.
  * Set clear productivity goals and expectations for individual and team performance.
  * Help team members manage their workload effectively to achieve both balance and results.
  * Have conversations about productivity and performance when necessary.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Ignoring Productivity):** A new manager tells their team not to work overtime under any circumstances but doesn't address the underlying issues (e.g., inefficient processes, unrealistic workload) that are preventing the team from completing their work within standard hours, leading to missed deadlines.
  * **Effective:** The manager encourages work-life balance but also works with the team to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in their processes. They help the team prioritize tasks and manage their workload effectively to meet productivity goals within reasonable working hours.

## Other Challenges for New Managers Prioritizing Kindness

Beyond the points from the image, here are additional challenges faced by new managers, particularly those who may struggle with balancing kindness and effectiveness:

### Difficulty Holding People Accountable

A strong desire to be liked can make it difficult for new managers to hold team members accountable for their commitments and performance.

#### Don't Do This

  * Avoid addressing missed deadlines or incomplete tasks.
  * Make excuses for underperforming team members.
  * Fail to follow through on consequences for not meeting expectations.

#### Do This

  * Clearly communicate expectations and agreed-upon deliverables.
  * Track progress and have regular check-ins.
  * Address instances where commitments are not met promptly and professionally.
  * Be consistent in applying standards and consequences.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Difficulty with Accountability):** A new manager assigns a task with a deadline, but when the deadline passes and the task isn't completed, the manager doesn't say anything to avoid confrontation.
  * **Effective:** When the deadline is missed, the manager talks to the team member, understands the reason for the delay, and discusses the importance of meeting commitments, working with the team member to create a plan to complete the task and addressing potential roadblocks.

### Overcommitting the Team

A new manager eager to please stakeholders or demonstrate value might agree to too many projects or deadlines without properly assessing the team's capacity.

#### Why it's a Mistake

Wanting to be seen as helpful and capable, a new manager might say "yes" to requests without considering the impact on their team's existing workload. This leads to burnout, missed deadlines, and decreased quality of work.

#### Don't Do This

  * Agree to all requests without evaluating your team's capacity.
  * Fear pushing back on unrealistic deadlines or workloads.
  * Fail to communicate workload issues to your own manager or stakeholders.

#### Do This

  * Understand your team's capacity and current workload.
  * Learn to assess new requests and their impact on existing priorities.
  * Communicate realistically about what your team can achieve and when.
  * Be prepared to negotiate deadlines or resources when necessary.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Overcommitting):** A new manager is asked to take on a new, large project and agrees immediately without considering the team's current heavy workload, leading to the team being stretched too thin and multiple project delays.
  * **Effective:** When asked to take on the new project, the manager reviews the team's current commitments, estimates the effort required for the new project, and discusses the impact on existing deadlines with their own manager, proposing a phased approach or requesting additional resources.

### Lack of Strategic Focus Due to Prioritizing Individual Happiness

Focusing heavily on individual team member happiness without aligning efforts with broader strategic goals can lead to a lack of direction and impact.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind manager prioritizes their team's well-being and satisfaction, which is important. However, if this leads to a lack of focus on the team's contribution to the overall business strategy or a reluctance to push for challenging goals, the team may become comfortable but ultimately less impactful.

#### Don't Do This

  * Prioritize team comfort over achieving challenging but necessary goals.
  * Fail to communicate the team's contribution to the larger organizational strategy.
  * Let individual preferences dictate team priorities without considering strategic importance.

#### Do This

  * Balance team well-being with the need to achieve strategic objectives.
  * Clearly communicate how the team's work contributes to the organization's goals.
  * Set challenging but achievable goals that align with the broader strategy.
  * Help team members see the value and impact of their work beyond their individual tasks.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Lack of Strategic Focus):** A new manager allows team members to work primarily on projects they personally find interesting, even if those projects are not the highest priority for the business, leading to the team being busy but not contributing significantly to key company objectives.
  * **Effective:** The manager understands the business's strategic priorities and aligns the team's projects and goals accordingly. While considering team members' interests, they prioritize work that has the greatest strategic impact and help the team understand *why* that work is important.

### Burnout from Trying to Please Everyone

Attempting to meet the expectations and desires of every team member, stakeholder, and manager simultaneously can lead to exhaustion and ineffectiveness.

#### Why it's a Mistake

A kind new manager may feel immense pressure to keep everyone happy – their team, their manager, and other departments they collaborate with. Trying to be everything to everyone is unsustainable and leads to burnout, frustration, and ultimately, the inability to effectively lead.

#### Don't Do This

  * Say yes to every request to avoid disappointing others.
  * Put everyone else's needs before your own well-being.
  * Avoid setting boundaries with demanding stakeholders.

#### Do This

  * Recognize that you cannot please everyone all the time.
  * Prioritize based on your team's goals and the organization's needs.
  * Learn to manage expectations and communicate boundaries.
  * Protect your own time and energy to ensure you can effectively support your team.

#### Example

  * **Ineffective (Burnout from Trying to Please):** A new manager constantly works late and on weekends to try and accommodate every request from their team, other departments, and their own manager, leading to exhaustion and decreased effectiveness.
  * **Effective:** The manager prioritizes tasks based on their importance and urgency, communicates realistic timelines, learns to politely decline requests that don't align with priorities, and manages their workload effectively to avoid burnout.

## Conclusion

Kindness is a valuable asset for a manager, fostering trust and a positive team environment. However, it must be coupled with clarity, assertiveness, and a focus on results. By being aware of these common mistakes – stemming from an overemphasis on kindness or a lack of experience in balancing different leadership demands – new managers can navigate the challenges of their role effectively. Learning to provide direct feedback, set boundaries, manage expectations, and prioritize strategically are crucial steps in developing into a well-rounded and successful leader who is both kind *and* effective. Continuous self-reflection, seeking feedback, and a commitment to learning are key to avoiding these traps and thriving in the management journey.
