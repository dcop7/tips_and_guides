## 3. OCI Architectural Fundamentals

Understanding OCI’s architecture is critical for any administrator. OCI is built on a modern, multi-tenant infrastructure that is both scalable and resilient.

### Physical and Logical Architecture

OCI’s physical architecture comprises state-of-the-art data centers distributed globally. These data centers are designed with redundancy, low latency, and high availability in mind. Administrators must be familiar with the following architectural layers:

- **Compute Layer:** Provides both virtualized and bare metal servers.
- **Storage Layer:** Supports various storage types including block, object, and file storage.
- **Networking Layer:** Comprises Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs), subnets, and gateways for connectivity.
- **Management Layer:** Includes the OCI Console, CLI, SDKs, and APIs for resource management.

On the logical side, OCI organizes resources in a way that aligns with enterprise governance, using compartments and tagging to provide a clear separation of resources.

### Regions, Availability Domains, and Fault Domains

OCI is divided into multiple geographic regions, each containing one or more Availability Domains (ADs). Each AD is an isolated data center within a region, and they are designed to be independent to minimize the risk of failure.

- **Regions:** Represent broad geographic areas and are the top-level container for OCI resources.
- **Availability Domains:** Are isolated from one another to prevent single points of failure.
- **Fault Domains:** Provide further isolation within an AD, ensuring that maintenance or failures in one fault domain do not impact others.

Administrators must design their deployments to distribute critical resources across ADs and fault domains to ensure high availability and resilience.
