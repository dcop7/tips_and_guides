## 2. OCI Core Architecture Overview

OCI is built on a modern, purpose-built infrastructure that addresses the limitations of traditional cloud computing. Some of the highlights of OCI’s architecture include:

- **Bare-Metal Performance:** OCI provides direct access to physical hardware through its bare-metal compute instances. This allows organizations to run high-performance, latency-sensitive applications without the overhead of virtualization layers.
- **Multi-Tenancy and Isolation:** Resources are isolated across different tenants using Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) and compartmentalization, which ensures secure boundaries between different projects and environments.
- **High Availability and Resiliency:** With multiple regions, availability domains (ADs), and fault domains, OCI is designed for business continuity and disaster recovery.
- **Integrated Services:** OCI integrates compute, storage, networking, database, and security services into one seamless platform, streamlining management and operations.

Below is a high-level diagram representing OCI’s core architecture components:

## 3. OCI Regions, Availability Domains, and Fault Domains

### 3.1 Regions
OCI’s infrastructure is globally distributed across multiple **Regions**. Each Region is an independent geographic area that contains a collection of data centers. When planning for high availability, administrators should select a Region that offers the best latency, compliance, and performance characteristics for their workloads.

#### Key points:
- **Geographic Isolation:** Regions are physically separated to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Regions help organizations comply with data residency and local regulatory requirements.

### 3.2 Availability Domains (ADs)
Within a Region, there are multiple **Availability Domains**. Each AD is a physically separate data center within a Region. ADs are designed to be isolated from each other to mitigate the impact of a localized failure.

#### Considerations for ADs:
- **Redundancy:** Deploy workloads across multiple ADs to ensure high availability.
- **Performance:** ADs offer high-speed, low-latency connectivity within a Region.

### 3.3 Fault Domains
Fault Domains are a further subdivision within an AD. They represent logical groupings of hardware and power resources that can be affected by localized issues such as power failures. 

| Aspect             | Description                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Logical segmentation within an AD                         |
| **Purpose**        | Mitigate risk of failure within a single AD                 |
| **Use Cases**      | Deploying instances across fault domains to avoid single point failures |

Administrators can design their deployments by considering fault domains to improve resilience and ensure that system failures do not affect all resources simultaneously.

      A[External Clients]
    end

    subgraph PublicSubnet
      B[Public Load Balancer]
    end

    subgraph PrivateSubnet1
      C[Web Server Instance]
      D[Application Server Instance]
    end

    subgraph PrivateSubnet2
      E[Database Instance]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    D --> E
```

This diagram shows a simplified multi-tier architecture:
- A public load balancer routes traffic from external clients to web and application servers located in private subnets.
- The application servers, in turn, connect to the database instance located in a separate subnet.

  user_ocid           = var.user_ocid
  fingerprint         = var.fingerprint
  private_key_path    = var.private_key_path
  region              = var.region
}

resource "oci_core_vcn" "my_vcn" {
  cidr_block     = "10.0.0.0/16"
  compartment_id = var.compartment_ocid
  display_name   = "MyVCN"
}

resource "oci_core_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vcn_id              = oci_core_vcn.my_vcn.id
  cidr_block          = "10.0.1.0/24"
  compartment_id      = var.compartment_ocid
  display_name        = "PublicSubnet"
  prohibit_public_ip_on_vnic = false
}

resource "oci_core_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vcn_id              = oci_core_vcn.my_vcn.id
  cidr_block          = "10.0.2.0/24"
  compartment_id      = var.compartment_ocid
  display_name        = "PrivateSubnet"
  prohibit_public_ip_on_vnic = true
}
```

This configuration illustrates how to define a VCN with two subnets—one public and one private—for your OCI environment.
